# Solutions to NCC Group (Matasano) Security Consultant Recruiting Challenges

I took a couple of weeks to complete these challenges. The recruiter told me I passed both challenges, but the position was filled and I need to wait a few month. I reached out later again a few month and get completely ignored.

In the end, I did not even get a phone interview. 

Hopefully whoever is applying will have better luck than I did. 

Note: These solutions are not perfect but will pass the challenge (unless they change it).

Hi Carl,

Allow me to introduce myself. I am [], a Regional Vice President at NCC Group. I am contacting you in regards to the public Github repository https://github.com/carlzoo/ncc-recruiting-challenge/ .

First I would like to apologize for the experience you had with our recruiting process. I recognize that our interview process is time-intensive and that feeling like you did not have clear communication throughout the process must have been very challenging.  While I cannot explain the reasons for the lack of communication, I will say that we have identified this as a problem and have worked over the past couple years at maturing our Talent Acquisition process and team to make sure these lapses of communication do not occur in the future.  I can fully understand your frustration at the situation.  I would recommend that you reapply and allow NCC Group to show you how we have improved our processes. I know it has been two years since you have applied and your career may have taken you in a different direction, but we are always recruiting for good security talent at varying levels.

Putting that to the side for a moment, I have to ask you to remove the solutions to our challenges from your public repository. As you very well know, our recruiting challenges are a major part of our recruiting process, and our candidates devote significant time and energy to completing these challenges. Publishing the content of our recruiting challenges is an infringement of our legally protected copyright and must therefore be removed.  Additionally, by hosting these solutions in a public forum, it compromises the integrity of our recruiting process and puts an undue scrutiny on those applying.

I hope that you can understand the predicament that this public repository has put NCC Group in and we can work to amicably remediate the situation.

Please feel free to reach out at any time.

Regional Vice President
